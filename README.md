# Visibility Compatibility Widget
 
A plugin to use the plugin Visibility via Umbra widget.

## Installation

- Download the **.dll** file of this repos [here](https://github.com/LightRob/Umbra.VisibilityCompatibilityWidget/tree/main/out/Release).
- Open Umbra Setting in FFXIV and go to **Plugins** page.
- Click on **Add Plugin** and find the .dll you downloaded earlier.
- Reload Umbra
- Now you can find the widget **Visibility Widget** and add it to your Umbra Toolbar.

## Usage

- **Left-click** on the widget to toggle Visibility active state.
- **Right-click** on the widget to open or close the Visibility configuration window.

## Information

This plugin does not automatically detect your current Visibility state. The first time you click on the widget, nothing might happen because the widget and Visibility are not synchronized. This issue can occur only after starting Umbra or if you change the Visibility active state without using this widget.
